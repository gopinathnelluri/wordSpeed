Jacob drew steel the sound echoing through the tavern and drawing every pair of eyes Zane's face went stony for a moment but then avalanched into laughter and mirth You'd kill me then monk? spat Zane You must have forgotten your own book Thou shalt not kill I'm not afraid of your threats The drunken brawler suddenly pulled two long knives from his belt twirling them like ballerinas I'm going to kill you now and take that book from you Ought to be worth something to somebody Zane leaped forward and Jacob's sword flashed in the torchlight A split second later Zane's blades clanged against the far walls But Jacob did not stop at disarming his opponent he was too deadly too proud No Jacob's weapon swung through the air the razor tip scraping Zane's neck slitting it The metal monk knelt beside his dying opponent Quietly he prayed over the man begging his Lord to forgive him his sins and wing this soul to heaven When he was done he caught a last flicker of light in Zane's eyes He whispered: If you had been more familiar with my book you might have known another verse: I come not to bring peace but a sword I did not seek a fight with you But I am through running
Theirs was a true love thought Tony one to stand the test of time Eva his soul-mate was somehow even more beautiful than the day they first met he realized And even though she always seemed to say something interesting it ultimately didn't matter as he was happy just to hear her soft melodic voice Someday soon he imagined they would have children together and their love would blossom as a family These wonderful thoughts made him feel warm and tingly inside Suddenly without warning Tony was yanked from his daydream by the doorbell He let out a long sigh realizing that that would be the courier with the divorce papers
The masked man put it simply: I'm going to kill you in five minutes and since James had heard him say the exact same line to three of his friends and noted with some alarm that the man had carried through on each occasion he knew exactly what lay in store for him He was tied down with barbwire to a rough sawed plank but comfort mattered little now After all the last thing he wanted to do with his last five minutes was think about how uncomfortable he was on that stupid board You'd think though that someone would've at least sanded it down a bit And why barbwire? Was that really necessary? Why couldn't he have been killed by a killer who preferred soft nylon rope? And why for that matter had he been positioned facing the wall with nothing interesting to look at? He was the only one of his friends who'd been put this way Nothing to see but cheap woodgrain paneling It was maddening What an insult! And to make matters worse he had to pee He didn't mind not getting a last cigarette He didn't smoke But he did have to pee Jesus Christ what a lousy way to spend five minutes
Jack tried to speak but failed the tears beginning to well Angie tried to speak but also failed her face becoming flush What do we do now? Jack finally stammered Don't know Angie responded barely audible The two sat staring for a long time sharing a stunned silence not really hearing the gentle clicking in the background How had they reached this point? What went wrong? All had been wonderful just a few moments ago as they worked as one to reach new levels of success Then without warning it happened Disk Error flashing repeatedly Though it was like Game Over from so many times before those words now took on their true sinister meaning Having nothing left but time to reflect Jack and Angie called it a night
He was bored So bored His great intellect seemingly inexhaustible was hungry for new challenges but he was the last of the great innovators society's problems had all been solved All seemingly unconnected disciplines had long since been found to be related in horrifically elusive and contrived ways and he had mastered them all He lay back in the dark and tried to relax He longed for the challenges of the past when his racing mind prevented him from sleeping It was tortuous at the time but he now looked back on those times enviously Then it hit him Since he couldn't be presented with a challenging problem any more all he had to do was to create a problem of his own design so complicated and with so many interrelated complex relationships that only he could untangle them and calculate the ultimate outcome But where to start? Then it hit him He opened his eyes in the dark and said Let there be light
Sarah was excited by the prospect of jumping back into the holographic synthesizer Living long-term aboard a space station was not her idea of paradise but the pay was irresistible if not the atmosphere Now her turn was again up to get away from it all if only for a few hours As usual she wanted to simulate a nighttime float in the creaky row boat on the small lake by her old Earth-bound Florida home The last time she did it she just laid back and though the irony was palpable simply looked up at the stars While she loved the light breeze that gently rocked the boat she did not appreciate the simulated insects with their all too real bites and buzzing about Sarah had been on that sterile space station a very long time now Whoever determined that virtual reality would truly fool the senses only if there was genuine environmental interaction Sarah thought probably needed to actually get out more In any case this time Sarah bent the rules more than a little by getting one of her programmer friends to hack the system for her and override life simulation on her program Now she could really relax just her the boat and those very distant stars Sarah happily entered the room ran the program and within a few seconds ceased to exist
